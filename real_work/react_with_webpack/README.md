# REACT WITH WEBPACK
I decided to go out of my comfort zone and learn how to creat a React app from scratch without using `create-react-app`, but used tools like `webpack`, `babel`, `ESLint`... Though I can't assume 100% efficiently in using these tools especially with the steep learning curve and configuration hell, but I can actually interpret and modified configurations filesd maintained by these tools.
